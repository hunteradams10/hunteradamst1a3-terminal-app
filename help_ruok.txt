This is a story-based game where you follow along reading the 
prompts and make choices accordingly. You can exit any time you
are asked for input by typing 'exit' and hitting Enter.

For questions where you have to enter an answer,
you can skip it by just pressing "Enter", although
this will be interpreted as an incorrect answer. 
You will still progress in the story, though. :)
